#Written Sept 30 2009
#This program fscked the mind of Adam Domurad; It is not completely efficient for sure but I was more concerned with making a working interpreter
#You can use as many as 256 nested loops on a 8 bit cell interpreter
#NOTE code will be parsed a lot faster without comment characters
#[first place 0 at start and place code input, working out if its a comment and correcting [ -> 1, ] -> 2, + -> 3, - -> 4, > -> 5, < -> 6, . -> 7, , -> 8]
#[Ascii: + is 43, , is 44, - is 45, . is 46, < is 60, > is 62, [ is 91, ] is 93]
#[Data used is 8 + Data used by subprogram * 2 + non-comment instructions in subprogram.]
#[It is possible but a good deal more complex to not use double the data the subprogram uses, the data pointer would have to be stored]
#[numerically and then shifted through the data area, and then restored.]
